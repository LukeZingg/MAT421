Even so, students often utilize ChatGPT to learn advanced mathematical concepts such as Linear Algebra, putting at risk their understanding and quality of education. As a result, in this research project we aim to investigate how ChatGPT can be used and modified to facilitate students’ understanding of mathematical concepts and minimize the spread of misinformation by enhancing ChatGPT’s accuracy through the development of AI agents with API to fact-check its outputs"

        "The articles we studied highlighted the shortcomings of ChatGPT in regards to its mathematical problem-solving accuracy. AI models have been shown to struggle with geometry and even basic arithmetic calculations, serving as an issue for using it as a reliable learning tool for students. In addition, students and teachers are using AI in all different realms of schooling to understand mathematical concepts. AI can be quite useful in offering a guiding hand to students in learning important ideas and helping teachers create lesson plans. Despite being a helpful teaching tool, the use of AI in educational settings is criticized due to its failure to generate accurate responses at all times. However, LLMs can be used to check AI’s answers, serving as a second step of verification, and helping further program the AI to be more accurate in certain topics, such as linear algebra. Since it has been proven that ChatGPT struggles with some simple mathematical concepts, we assume that it will also struggle in complex problems that are built on these concepts. Thus, we will analyze its performance in solving problems from a higher-level course such as Linear Algebra.  \n",

Using OpenAI's API, we will collect ChatGPT responses to generative examples of each of these topics, simulating students' frequent use of the tool for problem-solving. To assess the accuracy of these responses, we will develop a Python-based agent that integrates symbolic computation libraries such as SymPy or NumPy to fact check ChatGPT's output. As a result, this agent will verify ChatGPT answers to the questions and return a statement that confirms if ChatGPT was correct or not."

By integrating a fact-checking agent, we expect a significant improvement in the reliability of ChatGPT’s outputs, with incorrect answers being flagged and corrected.
